- **0â€“200**: High liquidation ratio, many borrows but few repayments
- **201â€“400**: Some usage diversity but still risk-prone (many borrows, few deposits)
- **401â€“600**: Balanced activity with moderate borrow/repay behavior
- **601â€“800**: Frequent depositors, rare liquidations, consistent usage
- **801â€“1000**: Highly stable users â€” regular deposits, prompt repayments, no risky behavior

##  Notes

- The model is unsupervised and rule-free, making it adaptable to new wallets and protocols.
- You can integrate labeled fraud/loan default data in the future to train supervised models.
